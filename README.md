# Budgeting-App

This is my first Website. I started off with learning with the odin project, I planned to use their full stack path for Ruby. I found it much harder to learn Ruby than python, so I pivoted to Python and Django. 

There are two goals of this app:
1. To learn full start Django devolopment with a real project
2. To create a useful budgeting app that I would actuall want to use to plan out my budget.
